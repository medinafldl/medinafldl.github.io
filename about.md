As an enthusiastic Data Scientist at Helmholtz Munich seeking a PhD in Computational Biology, I've used my abilities to create a R software for growth curve analysis or use deep learning to forecast diseases. When I'm not crunching data, I'm taking care of my houseplants or improving my knowledge of Python and R. With a strong desire to convert intricate data into practical insights, I'm prepared to take on issues one dataset (and cup of coffee) at a time.


### Research Interests
- Antimicrobial Resistance: Investigating the mechanisms and spread of resistance in bacterial populations.
- Bacterial Growth Curves: Modelling bacterial growth curves using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in R to understand and predict growth patterns.
- Flow Cytometry and RNA Sequencing: Integrating and analyzing flow cytometry and bacterial RNA sequencing data using optimal transport methods to uncover cellular heterogeneity and gene expression profiles.
